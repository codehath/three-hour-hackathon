I want to build an app with the following features:

1.  The User Can play music by showing the hand to the webcam.
2.  Each time the use moves the fingers / hand, the app will play a different note.
3.  The app will use the webcam to detect the hand and the fingers.
4.  The app should be able to select the instrument from a list of instruments.

The app should run in Windows, preferably in the browser.

You can use any libraries / frameworks you think are best for the job.
